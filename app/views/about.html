    <h2>what's this, then?</h2>
	<p>i like <a href="http://daringfireball.com/projects/markdown">markdown</a>. i write <a href="http://zacanger.com/blog">my blog</a> in it, and use it <a href="http://markdown-here.com/">in my email</a>. i use it to take notes. it's super handy for documentation. it makes long-form writing of any kind a much smoother, simpler process. markdown-specific editors have been described (not entirely inaccurately) as <a href="https://honza.ca/2015/02/markdown-editors-are-an-anti-pattern">an antipattern</a>, but given the wide range of markdown derivatives, plugins, and extensions in use&mdash;not to mention the complete lack of standardization of the original spec&mdash;it's sometimes helpful to see what one is working on in realtime.</p>
  <p>there are likely thousands of decent markdown editors, a large majority of them available <a href="https://npmjs.com/search?q=markdown">for free</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=markdown">source code</a>… and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=markdown+editor&submit=search">for multiple languages</a>. why not use one of those? i've used several. a lot of them are really great. none of them were what i was looking for.</p>
  <p><strong>markvi</strong> won't be for everyone. with a bit of hacking (and a crash course in vimscript) something could be worked up in vim itself. any one of a dozen popular IDEs and editors could be configured to preview markdown without much trouble. i put this one together because it satisfied <em>my</em> need for a <strong>no-config</strong>, fast-as-heck, always-available-everywhere setup with keybinds that make manipulating large blocks of text easy and lightning-quick.</p>
  <p>if you're not so much into the vi/vim way of life, simply removing or commmenting out the relevant lines (see the scripts directory) will make this a plain old markdown editor. if you're an emacs heathen, i'm sure there's a mode for that. :) </p>.
<p>oh, by the way&mdash;i'm <a href="http://zacanger.com/me">zac</a>. i'm told i'm a <em>technology hipster</em>, but i'm okay with that. please feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/zacanger/markvi">this project on github</a>, fork or clone away, use however you like; my own code is under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net">wtfpl</a>; please be respectful of the licenses of any dependencies.</p>
