demo of immutable with cursors (instead of flux)

this is also a good example to get an idea of using older (~v12) react

and to get a handle on react without much es2015 syntax

i wouldn't use this as a starting point for anything new, since it's
using older versions of libraries (including 6to5 which isn't even a thing
by that name anymore).

`npm i ; npm run build ; npm start`

then open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
