This is a super bare-bones boilerplate for React.

It's got the most basic Webpack config imaginable, and just three
source files: an entry point, a parent component (`App`), and a child
component (`Foo`, to demonstrate how to use pure functions as components).

To get going with this, `npm i` and `npm run dev`.

To build a (production) bundle, just `npm start`.
