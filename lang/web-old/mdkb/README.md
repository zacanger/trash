# semi-abandoned!

you should use the original instead, it's active and has cool new features like
git integration and things. [check it out here](https://github.com/ionutvmi/markdown-docs).

# [markdown knowledgebase](https://github.com/zacanger/mdkb)

See it live [here](http://mdkb.zacanger.com).

The demo's docs are [here](https://github.com/zacanger/doc.git).

## To use:

* `npm i`
* `echo "## This is some Markdown!" > content/somefile.md`
* `npm start`
* `content` can contain a `static` subdirectory.
  * This isn't indexed. It's for static files and stuff (images, for example).
