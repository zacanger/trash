## IMPORTANT
don't rely on this repo staying around.
i intend to move bits and pieces around to other, more relevant
repos and gradually work until i can just remove this one.

tiny itty bitty little examples of how to do basic things

there are a lot of tiny bare-node or bare-express little servers in here. if
you're looking for one, i'd recommend `tiniest-server.js`.

the examples of bundlers/build systems can be used as boilerplates (including
the makefile)

other than that, there are a few neat toys: a y combinator in js, a counter
thing that uses recursion (to satisfy a toy problem posed at school), a binary
search (which i _think_ is actually from addy osmani, but i'm not sure?), a way
around putting `console.log()` all over your code, and a and `format.js`, which
is node's `util.format()`, but just for the `%s`, for the browser/any
environment.
