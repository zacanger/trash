this is the electron-testing branch; hopefully shit doesn't break too badly, but if it does, that's chill too.

--------

a simple, beautiful markdown editor with a realtime preview pane  
based on codemirror  
using the always-fantastic marked parser by @chjj  

plans:
* rewrite parser (markdown-extra-ish, far future)
* actually implement the vi-like keybinds (see scripts/vi.js)
* eventual rewrite in coffeescript, jade, and stylus
* integrate with my rough attempt at a blog platform
* desktop client (electron/photon, or BAT)
