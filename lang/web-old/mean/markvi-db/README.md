### this is the db test branch! chances are it's really very broken. use the master branch, if you please.

simple markdown editor in angular with realtime preview
based on codemirror  
using the always-fantastic marked parser by @chjj  
oh, and it's got vi keybinds.

plans:
* rewritten parser
* nix angular, redo in vue
* desktop client (electron-test branch)
* mongo-based (internal) shared writing platform (think tumblr for people with attention spans, or medium if twitter hadn't been involved)
* reorg, gulpify, debowerificate, &c. (see branch next-restructure)
