this'll be a fast full mean-stack little webapp in the style of, say, a voat, or a lobsters, or some such.  (okay, fine,
it's a reddit/hacker news clone.)  part of the idea in doing this is to check out the different level of complexity
compared to the vue hacker news clone in this same repo (which was front-end only), or the meteor one (which isn't on my
github, because it was so stupid easy to put together i really don't think it counts).
